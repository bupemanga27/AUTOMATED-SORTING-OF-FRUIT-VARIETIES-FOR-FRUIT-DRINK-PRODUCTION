# AUTOMATED-SORTING-OF-FRUIT-VARIETIES-FOR-FRUIT-DRINK-PRODUCTION
This project helps in solving the difficult, tenuous and time-consuming problem of classification of oranges as the raw material for juice processing unit. It sorts oranges based on the captured image and its color. We employ image processing methods to separate oranges, and then classify them depending on how the orange looks. We used a dataset of images containing rotten and fresh oranges which were split into training and testing data. For each image we use image processing techniques to segment the oranges from the image. To classify the oranges, we first trained a machine learning model using the training dataset. On the test data we applied the machine learning model and classified them using binary classification. For implementing binary classification, we made use of Convoluted Neural Networks.
